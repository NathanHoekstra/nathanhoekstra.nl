Hello! welcome to my website! I finally reached a point where I was satisfied with the look of the website.

Way too much time has passed since I bought the domain since I was unable to find a template that suits me (and I was not going to make one since I am not a good web developer by any means).

I wanted to use a site/template that atleast had the following requirements:

- Fully responsive and accessible
- Light & dark mode :)
- Super fast performance
- Markdown support for blog posts, like this one
- Sitemap & rss feed
- Customizability

I came across the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) template which is using using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it checked all the boxes.

I currently customized the blog posts with a comment system using GitHub issues ([utterances](https://utteranc.es/)). More customization will be done when I have the time and motivation to do so.

The source code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NathanHoekstra/nathanhoekstra.nl)!

## So, what's next?

Most of the content on here will be related to software, 3d-printing and hardware development. If I have the time, I hope to write posts on a monthly basis.

Make sure to follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanhoekstra/) since I'll be sure to announce new posts on my timeline. Additionally, you can add my [RSS](https://nathanhoekstra.nl/rss.xml) feed to your favorite reader app. Thanks for stopping by!
