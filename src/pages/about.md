Welcome, thanks for visiting my website!

My name is Nathan Hoekstra. I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at the Dutch Ministry of Defence. I am running this website in my free time and I hope to create articles that are both useful and intresting. If you would like to connect, please use the social media links in the bottom.

**I will add my resume here in the future!**
